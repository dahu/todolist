Todolist
--------

__Tiny Toy Demo__

Reformat a todo-list with the command `:TodoFormat`

**`:TodoFormat` Options:**

* `missing=`
** `ignore`   -- Don't render missing nodes (DEFAULT. Rendered result
   resembles original source)
** `fill`     -- Render missing nodes (TODO: set missing text as another
   attribute)
** `collapse` -- Don't render missing nodes and collapse children to
   commence at missing node's depth.

* `completion=`
** `fractional` -- Render completions as n/m (e.g `[1/2]`)
*** NOTE: Where n==m (e.g. `[2/2]`), completion converted to `[x]`
** `percentage` -- Render completions as n % (e.g. `25%`)
*** NOTE: 100% is converted to `[x]`

There is also a hard-coded normal map, `<leader>lf` that calls
`:TodoFormat` on the current paragraph text-object.

To make `<leader>lf` more useful, the command `:TodoFormatDefaults` will
remember the `missing=` and `completion=` options you provide it for
subsequent `:TodoFormat` calls.
